<h3>
Upload videos only in *.mp4 format
</h3>
• Maximum file size is 25 MB
• Recommended display size is 720x480 pixels
• Only 2 videofiles per application possible

Important: It is much easier for you when you insert a screenshot of your video into the section 
for image upload and simultaneously give a direct link to the website where your video is stored
in the original; of course the storing place can be sites like YouTube, Vimeo, etc. too. In this
way your video can be viewed simply by clicking on the link. No pre-conversion necessary in this case.
