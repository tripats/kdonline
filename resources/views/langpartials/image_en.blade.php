How can I shrink pictures having more than 2.5 MB to a size having less than the required 2.5 and how to I convert
pictures to the required JPG format standard?
Easiest way is to use any photoeditor on your computer like Photoshop, Gimp, Paintshop or iPhoto and so on.
I you dont't have any download a simple Freeware-Imageviewer like p.ex. IrfanView (www.irfanview.de)
on your computer. It will enable you to rescale your picture in picture size, kb-size and JPG-quality to save it.
