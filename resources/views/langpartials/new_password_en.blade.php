Dear applicants. The Kuenstlerdorf-Online website has been updated to a new software.
We've migrated the old profiles and applications to the new system. (Only) if you had a profile on the old website and want to further use it,
you have to use the <a href="password/reset"> Reset password</a> link to receive a new password so you
can login on this site. Please check the spam folder if you do not receive an email with a password reset link.<br>
Alternative: If your old account has the <b>same email</b> address as one of your social media accounts, you can login with 
social media buttons to be found at the bottom of the website, without resetting your password
